<div style="padding: 20px;">
    <p>This application allows you to classify images with four binary labels: <strong>Cat</strong>, <strong>Morris</strong>, <strong>Entering</strong>, and <strong>Prey</strong>. Labels are stored directly within the image's EXIF metadata.</p>
    <p>Images are received via MQTT, stored in the <code>static/images</code> directory, and can be classified through the web interface.</p>
    <p>Once classified, images are moved to the <code>dataset/images</code> directory. You can also reclassify images from the gallery.</p>
